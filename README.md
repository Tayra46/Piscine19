# The 19 Piscine Experience

Before starting my journey at 19 School, I had to complete an intensive entry test known as the Piscine. This month-long coding bootcamp serves as a selection process for aspiring students and offers a deep dive into programming fundamentals.
## What is the Piscine?

The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is a 4-week coding challenge that tests not only your technical abilities but also your resilience, problem-solving skills, and capacity for self-learning. It’s an immersive experience designed to simulate the real-world challenges of software development, where participants are expected to work both independently and in collaboration with peers.
## What I Learned

During the Piscine, I worked on a variety of projects and exercises that helped me build a foundation in:

    # C Programming: 
      Learning the fundamentals of low-level programming, including memory management and pointers.
    # Algorithms and Logic: 
      Developing logical thinking to solve problems efficiently.
    # Unix Systems: 
      Gaining familiarity with the Unix environment, shell commands, and scripting.
    # Peer Learning: 
      Collaborating with other participants, sharing knowledge, and reviewing each other's code.

## The Challenge

The Piscine was demanding, with long hours and constant challenges, but it was also a rewarding experience that taught me to persevere in the face of complex problems. It’s a rite of passage for students joining the 19 curriculum and laid the groundwork for the projects and skills I’m now building.
